Show off your commit streaks with this wireless e-ink display. It uses an ESP32 to fetch and display your latest contributions.
Runs for ~3 months before needing a recharge via micro usb. Default refresh interval is 4hrs which can be configured. There is also a dark mode setting

## Configuration

Hold down the button for 2 seconds to go into wifi configuration mode. This will create a wifi network called "Contributions screen"

Once connected with your phone or laptop press "Sign In" to open the browser configuration

</p>

After saving your configuration the device will restart with the updated settings

- If there's an issue with the wifi connection you'll get a striked through wifi symbol
- If there's an issue with fetching the commit data from the api then you'll get a striked through link icon

## Hardware

- [LILYGOÂ® T5 2.13inch E-Paper Development Board](https://lilygo.cc/products/t5-v2-3-1)
  - These are normally used as shopping center price displays but also happen to be the perfect dimensions for this project. Shoutout to Lilygo for creating these neat little guys
  - I found the GDEM0213B74 to be a bit sharper than the DEPG0213BN which looked like it had some anti-aliasing built in that I couldn't disable
  - This specific board wasn't listed as supported by the greyscale gfx library however using one with similar specs did the trick
- 3.7V 1200mAh 603450 battery
  - 50mm x 34mm x 6mm
  - Great size for this project, fits quite snugly. A thinner battery might need something to prevent rattling around like some double sided tape
  - The Lilygo comes with a 1.25mm 2pin JST connector so don't need to worry about finding one with that connector
- 3d printed case and stand

  - Case features:
    - Buttons and switch, secured lid with screws, thin screen bezels and a mechanism to keep the screen firmly at the front of the case.
  - Available for purchase via [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/s/6b5f09b34c) store
  - For the wood style finish I printed with a Bambu Lab wood filament and applied an alcohol ink with a cheap and thick paintbrush
  - Other cases available:
    - Thingiverse model by [xl0e](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4670205)
    - Lilygo project by [Piotr-Kubica](https://github.com/piotr-kubica/weather-tiny)
    - Or build your own using this Lilygo reference model on [GrabCad](https://grabcad.com/library/lilygo-t5-2-13-1)

- M3 screws, 6mm
- M3 female thread inserts ~5.7mm
  - These are great, just push them into 3d prints with a soldering iron and you've got a perfect thread
- AWG 26-24 Heat shrink wire connectors or solder

## Software

- Configuration mode
  - When the esp32 wakes up we get a `esp_sleep_get_wakeup_cause` which we can use to determine whether it was due to the button being pressed or the sleep timer. If it was the button we check it again after 2 seconds and if it's still `LOW` (pressed) then enter config mode
  - In the [ConfigAccessPoint.h](https://github.com/HarryHighPants/esp32-git-contributions-epd/blob/main/ConfigAccessPoint.h) file the esp32 creates it's own wifi access point which when connected to uses a captive portal to show a html form. Before sending the html the current configuration values are injected into the forms inputs
  - When the user presses save they're navigated to /submit with the entered form values in the search params of the url
  - The esp32 then reads these and stores them in RTC memory before restarting
    - RTC memory persists through `esp_deep_sleep` but not when powered off
- Fetching contribution data
  - In the [ContribData.h](https://github.com/HarryHighPants/esp32-git-contributions-epd/blob/main/ContribData.h) file the esp32 first tries to connect to wifi via the provided wifi ssid and password
  - Once connected it does an api request to the configured simplified contributions api that returns an integer[] representing the level of commits for each day requested. e.g 2 weeks = [1, 0, 3, 1, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 1, 4, 0, -1, -1]
    - -1 means the day is later in the week
    - 0 for no commits today
    - 1-4 for the level of commits
  - The custom [github-contributions-api](https://github.com/HarryHighPants/github-contributions-api) is available on Github if you'd like to fork or host your own. It just uses the Github graphql api to fetch the data and then transforms it into the simplified integer[] response. It's written in NodeJS and Typescript. Technically this could serve as a habit tracker for other events using a different api that follows the same response structure, gym session for example
  - The retrieved data is deserialised using deserializeJson (probably overkill) and if it's changed, stored in RTC memory and rendered
- Rendering
  - In the [Rendering.h](https://github.com/HarryHighPants/esp32-git-contributions-epd/blob/main/Rendering.h) file we're utilising the [Adafruit GFX Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) with a [greyscale e-ink display library](https://github.com/ZinggJM/GxEPD2_4G) to draw the shapes, icons and text
  - The icons were created using a mix of Javls [image2cpp](https://github.com/javl/image2cpp) tool and Cowboys [Bitmap code generator](https://bitmap-code-generator.benalman.com/)

## Install

To install the latest precompiled build on your esp32

1. Download the latest zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/HarryHighPants/esp32-git-contributions-epd/releases)
1. If you're running Linux or Mac the [build_scripts](https://github.com/HarryHighPants/esp32-git-contributions-epd/tree/main/build_scripts) folder has bash commands to assist with the next steps
1. Plug in the esp32 and find it's connected port: [fetch_ports.bat](https://github.com/HarryHighPants/esp32-git-contributions-epd/blob/main/build_scripts/fetch_ports.bat)
1. Update the port number in the [flash.bat](https://github.com/HarryHighPants/esp32-git-contributions-epd/blob/main/build_scripts/flash.bat) and run the esptool write_flash command
